feat: Implement quick action buttons UX and fix stats page bugs

This commit includes bug fixes, UX improvements, comprehensive testing, and project organization.

## Bug Fixes

### Stats Page Display (Critical)
- **Fixed stats page showing only 1 game instead of all games**
  - Modified `services/stats_service.py`: Merge calculated stats into game objects instead of returning tuples
  - Modified `routes/stats_routes.py`: Pass 'games' variable to template and add hide_future_games filter
  - Resolves Jinja2 error: "'tuple' object has no attribute 'save_percentages'"
  - All 8 games now display correctly in stats tables

### Translation/UI
- Added 16 missing translation keys (EN/IT):
  - Actions: goal, goalie_save, actions, more_actions
  - Stats: penalty_drawn, penalty_taken, save_percent
  - UI: players, goalies, quick_actions_help_title, quick_actions_help_text
  - Other: plus_all, minus_all, opponent_goalie_not_enabled
- Fixed missing labels in edit mode buttons
- Fixed save/goalie_save conflict in templates

## Features

### Quick Action Buttons UX Enhancement
Implemented streamlined stat entry for live game tracking:

**Player Actions:**
- Quick buttons: ⚽ Goal, 👍 Assist, 🎯 SOG (always visible)
- Dropdown menu (⋮) for: +1/-1, Errors, Penalties, minus actions
- 2-column grid layout in dropdown for better space utilization

**Goalie Actions:**
- Quick buttons: 🧤 Save, ⛔ Goal Conceded (always visible)
- Dropdown menu (⋮) for: Assists, minus actions

**Mobile Optimization:**
- Touch targets: 44x44px minimum (48x48px on mobile)
- Responsive button sizing
- Improved dropdown menu readability

**User Guidance:**
- Added Quick Actions Guide info box (displayed in edit mode)
- Separate sections for Players and Goalies
- Explains button functionality and dropdown access

**Technical Changes:**
- Updated `templates/game_details.html`:
  - Replaced single dropdown with button group + dropdown combo
  - Added mobile-responsive CSS styles
  - Updated JavaScript `setEditMode()` function
- Button layout prevents mis-clicks during fast-paced game tracking

## Testing

### New Comprehensive Test Suite
Created `tests/test_stats_page_display.py` with 10 tests:
1. `test_all_games_displayed_in_tables` - Verifies all games appear
2. `test_game_columns_in_plusminus_table` - Counts game columns
3. `test_game_columns_in_goals_assists_table` - Validates table structure
4. `test_stats_data_structure_integrity` - Ensures no Jinja2 errors
5. `test_game_with_calculated_stats_fields` - Validates calculated fields
6. `test_stats_page_renders_without_jinja_errors` - Integration test
7. `test_multiple_games_multiple_players` - Complex scenarios
8. `test_season_filter_shows_correct_games` - Season filtering
9. `test_team_filter_shows_correct_games` - Team filtering
10. `test_no_games_displays_gracefully` - Empty state handling

All 10 tests pass successfully. These tests would have caught the stats page bug immediately.

### Test Organization

## Impact

**User Experience:**
- ⚡ Faster stat entry: Most common actions now single-click (vs 2-click dropdown)
- 📱 Better mobile experience: Larger touch targets, responsive design
- 📊 Stats page fixed: All games now display correctly
- 🌐 Complete translations: No more missing labels in edit mode
- 📚 Clear guidance: Help text explains new button system

**Code Quality:**
- ✅ Test coverage improved: 10 new integration tests
- 🐛 Bug prevention: New tests catch similar data structure issues
- 📁 Better organization: Scripts and tests in proper directories
- 📖 Documentation: Clear guides for bug fixes and migrations

## Why This Change

**Stats Page Bug (Critical):**
- Users could only see 1 game out of 8 in statistics tables
- Jinja2 template errors prevented proper data display
- Root cause: Data structure mismatch (tuples vs game objects)
- Impact: Made stats page essentially unusable with multiple games

**UX Improvement (High Value):**
- Original design required 2 clicks for every action (open dropdown → select action)
- During live games, speed is critical for accurate stat tracking
- Quick buttons reduce most common actions from 2 clicks to 1 click
- Mobile-friendly design enables stats tracking from phones/tablets

**Testing Gap (Quality):**
- Existing tests only checked HTTP 200 status, not actual content
- Stats page bug went undetected despite having tests
- New test suite specifically validates game count, data structures, Jinja2 rendering

**Project Organization:**
- Scripts and tests scattered in root directory
- Moved to standard project structure for better maintainability

## Breaking Changes

None. All changes are backward compatible:
- Existing routes and URLs unchanged
- Game data structure unchanged
- Template interfaces consistent
- Configuration format compatible

## Migration Notes

No migration required. Changes are transparent to existing installations.

## Testing Done

✅ All 10 new stats page tests pass
✅ Manual testing of quick action buttons in edit mode
✅ Mobile responsiveness verified (44x44px touch targets)
✅ Stats page displays all 8 games correctly
✅ Translation keys verified in both EN and IT
✅ Dropdown menu structure validated
✅ Button functionality tested on sample game data
